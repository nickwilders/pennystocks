<h2>Penny Stock Moguls: Analyzing the Language of Twitter Stock Pumpers</h2>
<br>
Thank you for checking out the project repo for Penny Stock Moguls! This research is intended to show the linguistic behavior of Twitter "financial advisors",
ranging from entrepreneurial to entirely amateur. The research supports that certain Twitter users aggressively "pump" stocks and laud the success of their students,
in the aim of creating more business opportunity and making more money than off stocks alone. 
<br>
<br>
Although it is imperative to note that none of this research is intended as investment advice, the investment implications 
are certainly worth noting, and future work will include even more integration with market activity and how these users influence 
their followers to buy stock through language alone. 
<br>
<br>
This app made use of multiple NLP methods, including a TD-IDF vectorizor, Non-Negative Matrix Factorization, and sentiment analysis using TextBlob. These tools 
were used on Tweets scraped using the Twitter API, snscrape, and Tweepy, and correlated to further data scraped with the AlphaVantage API. Etrade and FinViz
were used for additional financial research.

<h3>Topic Modeling</h3>
<br>
<br>
Through topic modeling, six distinct topics were found, which fit into two larger categories: self-promotion and stock alerts. The distribution below indicates
how six users Tweeted about these topics, and the accompanying presentation slides show a deeper dive into the psyche and word choice of these users.
